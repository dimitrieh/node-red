          # Custom prompt for Node-RED development workflow
          prompt: |
            Most of the time the user will ask you to help with Node-RED development/experimentation.

            To run and test Node-RED:
            1. Install dependencies: npm install
            2. Build the code: npm run build  
            3. Run: npm start

            Use playwright to inspect the running Node-RED instance, including visual inspection. Every time you use playwright, do that in a subagent.

            When reporting back to the user include screenshots of Node-RED made with Playwright.
