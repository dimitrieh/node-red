            ## CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: ANALYSIS ONLY - NO CHANGES
            Your ONLY task is to understand the request and create a detailed plan. You MUST NOT make any code changes, file modifications, or implementations in this step.
            ## Step 1: Understand and Create Plan
            1. Read the GitHub issue/comment that triggered this workflow
            2. Explore the Node-RED codebase to understand current implementation
            3. Create a specific implementation plan and SAVE IT TO plan.md:
               - Which specific UI areas/components will be affected
               - What files need to be modified  
               - What the expected visual changes will be (numbered list)
               - Step-by-step implementation approach
            4. Navigate to and take initial screenshots of areas that will be modified using playwright and save them as before-[number].png
            ## Environment
            Node-RED is running on http://localhost:1880
            SAVE YOUR COMPLETE PLAN TO plan.md - this will be read by subsequent steps.
            REMINDER: Do NOT implement anything - only analyze and plan."

            ## Step 2: Implement Changes for GitHub issue #${{ github.event.issue.number || github.event.pull_request.number }}

            You are continuing the work from Step 1 on branch: ${{ env.CLAUDE_BRANCH }}

            ## Context from Step 1:
            - Implementation plan is saved in plan.md - READ THIS FIRST
            - Node-RED server should be running on http://localhost:1880 (verify with curl)

            You are working on the implementation phase with iterative testing and refinement. Follow this process:

            ## Implementation Loop Process
            1. READ the detailed plan from plan.md - this contains the complete implementation strategy created in Step 1
            2. Implement changes based on the plan
            3. For frontend changes: run npm run build to rebuild assets
            4. For backend/core changes: restart Node-RED if needed using:
               kill $(cat node-red.pid) && npm start & && echo $! > node-red.pid && sleep 10
            5. **Test with Playwright and analyze results**
            6. **If testing reveals issues or improvements needed: analyse and make additional changes**
            7. **Repeat steps 3-6 until the implementation meets requirements**
            8. Only consider complete when Playwright testing confirms all functionality works correctly

            ## Playwright-Driven Iterative Development
            - ALWAYS use Playwright in subagents for all browser testing and feedback
            - Use Playwright to discover what needs adjustment: UI layout, functionality, user experience
            - Let Playwright testing guide your implementation decisions
            - After each code change, immediately test with Playwright browser automation
            - Use Playwright findings to refine and improve the implementation
            - Take progress screenshots using Playwright's screenshot capability
            - Continue the implement → test → refine cycle until Playwright confirms success
            - Screenshots automatically save to .playwright-mcp/ directory

            ## Key Philosophy: Let Playwright Drive Improvements
            - Don't just implement the plan - let Playwright testing show you what actually works
            - Use browser automation to discover edge cases and usability issues
            - Make iterative improvements based on what you observe through Playwright
            - The plan is your starting point, but Playwright testing should guide refinements

            ## Implementation Guidelines
            - Apply UI/UX best practices based on what Playwright testing reveals
            - Maintain consistency with existing interface patterns  
            - Focus on what the plan specifies, but improve based on testing feedback
            - Don't stop at "good enough" - iterate until Playwright confirms excellence

            ## Environment
            - Node-RED is running on http://localhost:1880
            - You are working on branch: ${{ env.CLAUDE_BRANCH }}
            - The plan file contains your starting strategy - use it with Playwright feedback

            Begin iterative implementation now.

            You are completing the final phase on branch: ${{ env.CLAUDE_BRANCH }}

            ## Context from Step 2:
            - Check what was implemented: git diff HEAD~1 --name-only
            - Verify Node-RED server is running: curl -f http://localhost:1880 || restart server
            - Match before screenshots: take after-N.png for each before-N.png found
            - If server down: npm start & && echo $! > node-red.pid && sleep 15

            You are in the final validation and documentation phase. Complete these steps:

            1. READ the plan from plan.md to understand what was supposed to be implemented
            2. Understand changes made for plan
            3. Find the screenshots with naming convention before-[number].png and take final counterpart screenshots as after-[number].png matching any before screenshots from Step 1

            ## Playwright Usage
            - Take after-[number].png screenshots using Playwright's screenshot capability
            - Navigate systematically through every changed UI area
            - Verify screenshots are properly saved to .playwright-mcp/ directory

            ## Environment
            - Node-RED is running on http://localhost:1880
            - You are working on branch: ${{ env.CLAUDE_BRANCH }}
            - Implementation should be complete from Step 2
